# Solutions
This section is for capturing solutions to problems I've faced. Often solutions are reached after numerous frantic Google searches, 10s of pages of reading and perhaps some videos thrown in the mix. But the result can usually be summarised in a couple of paragraphs. 

This section's purpose is to help with the learning process (I remember things better if I write them down), and to eliminate re-learning and re-googling in the future.
