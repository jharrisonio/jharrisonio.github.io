Today I'm looking at something non-technical! How to write a good email. Specifically how to write an email to a prospective customer to get them interested in my product.

## What I already know
I've read a lot about pitching and selling in the past, but unless you're doing it every day the details can get a bit foggy. I'm going to start by refreshing my memory of things I've read before.

[Pitch Anything by Oren Klaff](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10321016-pitch-anything)
This book introduces a technique called the STRONG method.

S = Set the Frame
T = Tell the Story
R = Reveal the Intrigue 
O = Offer the Prize
N = Nail the Hook-Point
G = Get the Deal

It revolves more around pitch meetings rather than emails. I'll consider these concepts but continue looking for others


[Cold Email Statistics by Gong](https://www.gong.io/blog/cold-email-stats/)
I really like the summaries that Gong provide based on the data they collect form their sales platform. Here are the key takeaways from this article:

1. Send longer emails (4+ sentences are 15x more likely to book a meeting). 30 - 150 words
2. Make it personalized, direct and intentional in every sentence
3. Don't talk about ROI (-15% success rate)
4. Use the "interest CTA". There are 3 types of CTAs, the "interest" one performs best at 30%
5. Don't ask for thoughts (-20%)
6. Don't guilt them (saying "I never hear back..."). I wouldn't do this anyway
7. Use a "nicety". Saying "hope all is well" actually increases success by 24%

They also have some great [cold email templates](https://www.gong.io/content/cold-email-templates/) and [highly effective email CTAs](https://www.gong.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/3-43-Highly-Effective-Email-CTAs.pdf)


## Further research
I really like the Gong email templates but I want to see if there are some other ones out there on the web. A quick Google search for "cold email templates" gives me a few good ones:

* [7 Best cold Email Templates for Effective Sales Outreach](https://elasticsales.com/cold-email-templates/)
* [15 Cold Email Templates to Generate More Leads](https://mailshake.com/blog/cold-email-templates/)
* [How to write cold email best practices](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-write-cold-email-best-practices-5-templates-)


Flicking through the results above I like the following forumlas.

### AIDA (attention-interest-desire-action)

```text wordWrap
Hi {{name}},

What would you do with an extra 10 hours each week?

I ask because clients like yourself have seen savings like these – if not more – after adding our software to their tech stacks.

Just ask experts like Gary Vaynerchuk, Tim Ferriss, and Malcolm Gladwell, who we’re happy to count as satisfied customers.

I’d love to set up a time to walk you through a personalized demo. Would you have some free time next week to connect?
```


### Mention a competitor's product
In my case it wouldn't be a competitor, but a piece of software or a tool. 

```text
Hi {{Name}},

Just ran across your website and noticed you were using {{Your competitor’s product}}. How are you liking it? I run a {{service}} called {{your company}}.

It’s just like {{your competitor’s product}}, only {{key differentiator}}. If you’re up for it, I would love to jump on a quick call with you and get your opinion on how we could make {{prospect’s company}} better (and see if it would make sense for us to work together).

Would {{date and time}} be a good time for you? (If not, I’m flexible, just let me know).
```


## Summary
Here are the things I like the most out of all this research:

1. More than 4 sentences but less than 150 words
2. Make it personal - introduce myself, add something specific about their business
3. Mention they are using X technology (or any other info I can find about the company)
4. If they are in my area, mention I am nearby
5. Add a nicety
6. Finish with a question, "Would you be interested.." or "Should we discuss this in more detail.."?

I finished the new template and sent it to the first 100 contacts. Let's wait and see how it performs when A/B tested against the old one.
