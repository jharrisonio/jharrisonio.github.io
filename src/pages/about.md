# About

I've created this website as a personal space to capture 3 different types of content:
- Solutions to problems I faced
- Tutorials or guides to help others
- Interesting thoughts shared through a blog


## Things I do
While this site isn't intended to be a résumé I felt it necessary to list some of my experiences here for context:  
 - Customer workshops:  Identifying requirements and designing technical solutions
 - Product demos & tutorials: Live presentations, video recordings & written documentation 
 - Low code: While I hate the term 'low code', I believe it's the future of programming
 - Proof of concepts: Building small apps for customers to illustrate the benefits of a proposed solution 
 - Programming: In my spare time I build personal projects using Javascript/Typescript
 - Design: I studied visual arts at school and while my design skills are limited I try to put them to good use every now and then
