This presents a few challenges:\\n\\n1. What is the criteria for finding suitable companies?\\n2. Where is there a large enough database of companies that is easily accessible?\\n3. Why would they be interested in what I have to say?\\n\\nThe criteria was fairly easy to identify. Any companies we contact must be using NodeJS, as our platform is based on this technology. Ideally they would be a smaller company that is able to implement change and try new software easily without a lot of red tape. Any familiarity with similar platforms like Vercel would be a bonus, as would a current growth or restructuring phase. In summary:\\n\\n - NodeJS\\n - Fewer than 100 employees\\n - Familiarity with hosting/CI/CD automation tools\\n - Growing or restructuring\\n\\n## The tech stack\\nI chose to use [Puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) - *\\"a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol.\\"*. To extract elements from the returned HTML, I used [Cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio). I bundled these into a friendly CLI using [Inquirer.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). This is my first time building a proper CLI tool with Javascript, so I followed [this tutorial](https://www.christiandimas.com/build-interactive-cli-using-typescript/).\\n\\n\\n## Crawling job ads\\n\\n## Getting company details\\nMore often than not, job sites don\'t include the company\'s domain on the listing. I\'m assuming this is to prevent potential applicants from bypassing the job site and going straight to the employer.
